Staken de stemmen bij herstemming, dan is de lijst die de jongste kandidaat bevat, verkozen.\\n\\nDeze installatievergadering wordt samengeroepen door de uittredende voorzitter van de districtsraad uiterlijk dertig dagen na de installatie van de gemeenteraad.\\n\\n§ 2. Bij een tussentijdse vacature voor het lidmaatschap van het districtscollege of het voorzitterschap, gaat de raad binnen twee maanden over tot de opvolging. De verkozenen voor de raad kunnen daartoe kandidaten voordragen. Hiervoor wordt per mandaat een gedagtekende akte van voordracht neergelegd in de handen van de voorzitter van de raad, uiterlijk drie dagen voor de vergadering waar de verkiezing op de agenda staat.\\n\\nOm ontvankelijk te zijn, moeten de akten van voordracht ondertekend zijn door ten minste een meerderheid van de personen die op dezelfde lijst werden verkozen en door de voorgedragen kandidaat. Als de lijst waarop het kandidaat-lid van het districtscollege of de kandidaat-voorzitter voorkomt, slechts twee verkozenen telt, volstaat, voor de naleving van het voorgaande, de handtekening van één onder hen. Behoudens in geval van overlijden van, of afstand van het mandaat van districtsraadslid door een voorgedragen kandidaat, kan niemand meer dan een akte van voordracht ondertekenen voor hetzelfde mandaat. Een verkozene die meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekent, kan voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de districtsraad niet worden benoemd of verkozen als voorzitter van de districtsraad, lid van het districtscollege of voorzitter van een commissie van de districtsraad en kan de gemeente niet vertegenwoordigen of namens de gemeente een mandaat bekleden in gemeentelijke extern verzelfstandigde agentschappen of andere verenigingen, stichtingen of vennootschappen. Indien de betrokken verkozene reeds een dergelijk mandaat bekleedt, vervalt dit van rechtswege voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de raad.\\n\\nDe akte van voordracht kan ook de einddatum van het mandaat van de kandidaatvoorzitter en van de kandidaat-leden van het districtscollege vermelden. In dat geval kan op de akte van voordracht de naam vermeld worden van de persoon die hem zal opvolgen of van de personen die hem zullen opvolgen voor de resterende duur van het mandaat. In voorkomend geval zijn de voorzitter en het lid van het districtscollege bij het bereiken van de einddatum van het mandaat van rechtswege ontslagnemend en worden ze van rechtswege opgevolgd door de persoon die in de akte van voordracht als opvolger is vermeld. Als het mandaat eindigt voor de einddatum, vermeld in de akte, of als de persoon die in de akte van voordracht is vermeld als de opvolger van de voorzitter en van het lid van het districtscollege, zijn mandaat niet opneemt, neemt de eerstvolgende opvolger vervroegd het mandaat op. Als de persoon die als laatste opvolger is vermeld, het mandaat niet kan opnemen, wordt tot vervanging overgegaan overeenkomstig deze paragraaf waarbij het mandaat, tot aan de nieuwe verkiezing, uitgeoefend wordt overeenkomstig artikel 8, § 4, tweede en derde lid, of overeenkomstig artikel 50, § 2 en § 3, met dien verstande dat gemeenteraad moet worden vervangen door districtsraad, gemeenteraadslid moet worden vervangen door districtsraadslid, de schepen vervangen wordt door het lid van het districtscollege en het schepenmandaat vervangen wordt door het mandaat van het lid van het districtscollege.\\n\\nDe verkiezing vindt plaats bij geheime stemming en bij volstrekte meerderheid door zo veel afzonderlijke stemmingen als er tijdens de vergadering van de raad mandaten te begeven zijn.\\n\\nAls voor een te begeven mandaat slechts één kandidaat werd voorgedragen, verloopt de stemming in een ronde. In elk ander geval en als na twee stemmingen geen kandidaat de meerderheid heeft verkregen, wordt er opnieuw gestemd over de twee kandidaten die de meeste stemmen hebben behaald. Staken de stemmen bij de herstemming, dan is de jongste kandidaat verkozen.\\n\\n§ 3. Het aantal leden van het districtscollege wordt bepaald op maximum tweederde van het aantal leden, bepaald door artikel 44, § 1, toegepast voor de overeenkomstige gebiedsomschijving, met een maximum van vijf. Bij een breuk wordt er afgerond naar het hogere aantal. Artikel 44, § 2, is van overeenkomstige toepassing. De districtsraad kan beslissen dat de voorzitter van de districtsraad geen deel uitmaakt van het districtscollege en het college niet voorzit. In dat geval kiest het districtscollege in zijn midden een afzonderlijke voorzitter van het districtscollege.\\n\\n§ 4. Het districtscollege bestaat uit personen van verschillend geslacht.\\n\\nIndien het districtscollege niet rechtsgeldig blijkt samengesteld te zijn overeenkomstig het eerste lid, wordt het laatste overeenkomstig dit artikel verkozen lid van het districtscollege in rang, van rechtswege vervangen door het op dezelfde lijst verkozen districtsraadslid van het andere geslacht met de meeste naamstemmen. Als verschillende raadsleden van het andere geslacht een gelijk aantal naamstemmen hebben behaald, geniet het districtsraadslid dat de hoogste plaats op de lijst bekleedt voorrang onder die raadsleden. Als er geen verkozen districtsraadsleden van het andere geslacht op die lijst voorkomen, wordt het lid van het districtscollege van rechtswege vervangen door de eerste opvolger van het andere geslacht op die lijst.\\n\\nIn afwijking van het tweede lid wordt, indien het districtscollege niet rechtsgeldig blijkt te zijn samengesteld overeenkomstig het eerste lid, en ingeval het overeenkomstig artikel 274, §§ 1 tot 3, laatst verkozen lid van het districtscollege in rang, bij de verkiezing van de districtsraadsleden verkozen werd op een lijst die maar één kandidaat bevat, het voorlaatste lid van het disctrictscollege in rang vervangen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid. Als ook het voorlaatste lid van het districtscollege in rang verkozen werd op een lijst die maar één kandidaat bevat, wordt het derde laatste lid in rang, of in voorkomend geval het eerstvolgende laatste lid van het districtscollege in rang, vervangen overeenkomstig dezelfde bepalingen.\\n\\n§ 5. De bepalingen van artikelen 47, 48, 49, 50, §§ 2 en 3, 69, 70 , 71 en 74bis zijn, voorzover ze respectievelijk de burgemeester en de schepenen betreffen, ook van toepassing respectievelijk op de voorzitter en op de leden van het districtscollege met dien verstande dat:\\n1° de districtsraad in de plaats treedt van de gemeenteraad, de voorzitter van de districtsraad in de plaats treedt van de voorzitter van de gemeenteraad, het districtscollege in de plaats treedt van het college van burgemeester en schepenen en de districtssecretaris in de plaats treedt van de gemeentesecretaris;\\n2° de wedde van de leden van het districtscollege wordt bepaald door de Vlaamse Regering, daarbij kan rekening gehouden worden met de omvang van de bevoegdheden die aan de districten toegewezen worden, alsook met het inwonersaantal van het district.\\n\\n§ 6. Voor ze hun mandaat opnemen, leggen de voorzitter van de districtsraad en de leden van het districtscollege de volgende eed af : « Ik zweer de verplichtingen van mijn mandaat trouw na te komen. ».

Overtreding van dit verbod heeft in alle akten van voordracht de ongeldigheid tot gevolg van alle handtekeningen die in strijd met dit voorschrift werden geplaatst. De sanctie vermeld in § 1 ten aanzien van de verkozene die meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekent, is eveneens van toepassing. De akte van voordracht kan tevens de einddatum van het mandaat van de kandidaat-voorzitter vermelden. In dat geval kan op de akte van voordracht de naam vermeld worden van de persoon die hem zal of de personen die hem zullen opvolgen voor de resterende duurtijd van het mandaat.

Bij staking van stemmen in de eerste stemronde komt de kandidaat die bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald, in aanmerking voor de tweede stemronde. De kandidaat die in de tweede stemronde de meerderheid van de stemmen heeft behaald, is verkozen tot voorzitter. Bij staking van stemmen in de tweede stemronde is de kandidaat die bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald, verkozen tot voorzitter.

Bij gelijke anciënniteit geniet het gemeenteraadslid dat bij de laatste volledige vernieuwing van de gemeenteraad het hoogste aantal naamstemmen heeft behaald, de voorkeur. Als het gemeenteraadslid met de meeste anciënniteit de voorzitter in die gevallen niet kan vervangen, wordt het voorzitterschap waargenomen door een ander gemeenteraadslid in volgorde van anciënniteit. Bij gelijke anciënniteit wordt het mandaat waargenomen door het gemeenteraadslid dat bij de verkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald.\\n\\nDe voorzitter die als verhinderd wordt beschouwd of tijdelijk afwezig is, wordt vervangen zolang hij verhinderd of tijdelijk afwezig is.

De rang van de schepenen wordt bepaald door de rangorde op de gezamenlijke akte van voordracht. In geval van afzonderlijke verkiezing van de schepenen wordt de rang van de schepenen bepaald door de volgorde van de stemmingen. De schepenen die op grond van § 1, tweede lid, § 3, tweede lid of op grond van artikel 44, § 4, tweede lid een schepen opvolgen, nemen de rang in in volgorde van hun verkiezing of benoeming.
