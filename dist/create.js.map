De commissies kunnen steeds deskundigen en belanghebbenden   horen.\\n\\nIn elke gemeente wordt minstens een commissie opgericht die waakt   over de afstemming van het gemeentelijk beleid op het beleid van de   intergemeentelijke samenwerkingsverbanden en verzelfstandigde agentschappen van   de gemeente. De gemeente richt hiertoe ofwel een aparte commissie op, ofwel   integreert zij deze taak in de verschillende bestaande commissies.\\n\\n§ 2.   Artikelen 28 en 35 zijn van overeenkomstige toepassing op de vergaderingen en de   stemmingen in de commissies.\\n\\n§ 3. De mandaten in iedere commissie worden   evenredig verdeeld over de fracties waaruit de gemeenteraad is samengesteld. De   gemeenteraad bepaalt per gemeenteraadscommissie het aantal leden, alsook de   wijze waarop de evenredigheid wordt berekend. Deze berekeningswijze geldt voor   alle commissies die de gemeenteraad opricht. De evenredigheid vereist in ieder   geval dat de som van het aantal mandaten dat toekomt aan de fracties waarvan   leden deel uitmaken van het college van burgemeester en schepenen steeds hoger   is dan de som van het aantal mandaten dat toekomt aan de andere fracties. Elke   fractie wijst de mandaten toe, die haar overeenkomstig deze berekeningswijze   toekomen, door middel van een voordracht, gericht aan de voorzitter van de   gemeenteraad. Als de voorzitter van de gemeenteraad voordrachten ontvangt voor   meer kandidaten dan er mandaten te begeven zijn voor een fractie, dan worden de   mandaten toegewezen volgens de volgorde van voorkomen op de akte van   voordracht.\\n\\nTot de eerstvolgende volledige vernieuwing van de   gemeenteraad wordt een fractie geacht eenzelfde aantal leden in de commissies te   behouden. Indien één of meerdere leden verklaren niet meer te behoren tot de   fractie als vermeld in artikel 38 kan dit lid niet meer zetelen, noch als lid   van deze fractie, noch als lid van een andere fractie. Niettemin behouden deze   fracties het oorspronkelijke aantal leden in de commissie.\\n\\nOm   ontvankelijk te zijn moet de akte van voordracht voor elk van de   kandidaat-commissieleden ten minste ondertekend zijn door een meerderheid van de   leden van de fractie waarvan het kandidaat-commissielid deel van uitmaakt.   Indien de fractie van het kandidaat-commissielid slechts uit twee verkozenen   bestaat, volstaat de handtekening van een van hen. Niemand kan meer dan een akte   ondertekenen per beschikbaar mandaat voor de fractie.\\n\\nAls ten gevolge van   de toepassing van de evenredige vertegenwoordiging overeenkomstig het eerste lid   een fractie niet vertegenwoordigd is in een commissie, kan de fractie een   raadslid aanwijzen dat als lid met raadgevende stem in de commissie   zetelt.\\n\\n§ 4. De burgemeester of schepenen kunnen geen voorzitter zijn van   een gemeenteraadscommissie.\\n\\n§ 5. Het huishoudelijk reglement bepaalt de   nadere regelen inzake de samenstelling en de werkwijze van de commissie, alsook   inzake de toekenning van presentiegelden, met dien verstande dat leden met   raadgevende stem als vermeld in paragraaf 3 hetzelfde presentiegeld krijgen als   de andere leden. Indien een lid met raadgevende stem lid is van verscheidene   commissies, kan het aantal toegekende presentiegelden jaarlijks nooit hoger zijn   dan het hoogste presentiegeld dat theoretisch toegekend kan worden aan een vast   lid. Voor de berekening van dit maximumbedrag wordt rekening gehouden met het   aantal commissievergaderingen die voor een vast lid recht geven op   presentiegeld.\"\n}, \n\"_:gemeentedecreet-40\": {\n\"ref\": \"a1061861\",\n\"text\": \"De gemeenteraad stelt bij de aanvang van de zittingsperiode een huishoudelijk reglement vast waarin aanvullende maatregelen worden opgenomen in verband met de werking van de raad en waarin minstens bepalingen worden opgenomen over:\\n1° de vergaderingen waarvoor presentiegeld wordt verleend, het bedrag van het presentiegeld en de nadere regels in verband met de eventuele terugbetaling van specifieke kosten die verband houden met de uitoefening van het mandaat van gemeenteraadslid of lid van het college van burgemeester en schepenen;\\n2° de wijze van verzending van de oproeping en het ter beschikking stellen van het dossier aan de gemeenteraadsleden, alsook de wijze waarop de gemeentesecretaris of de door hem aangewezen personeelsleden, aan de raadsleden die erom verzoeken, technische inlichtingen verstrekken over die stukken;\\n3° de wijze waarop de plaats, de dag, het tijdstip en de agenda van de vergaderingen van de gemeenteraad openbaar worden gemaakt;\\n4° de voorwaarden voor het inzagerecht en het recht van afschrift voor gemeenteraadsleden en de voorwaarden voor het bezoekrecht aan de instellingen en diensten die de gemeente opricht en beheert;\\n5° de voorwaarden waaronder de gemeenteraadsleden hun recht uitoefenen om aan de burgemeester en aan het college van burgemeester en schepenen mondelinge en schriftelijke vragen te stellen;\\n6° de wijze van notulering en de wijze waarop de notulen van de vorige vergadering ter beschikking worden gesteld van de gemeenteraadsleden;\\n7° de nadere regels voor de samenstelling en de werking van de commissies en de fracties.\\n8° de wijze van bezorgen van het meerjarenplan, de wijzigingen aan het meerjarenplan, het budget, de budgetwijzigingen en de jaarrekening aan de raadsleden;\\n9° de wijze waarop en de persoon door wie de stukken, vermeld in artikel 182, worden ondertekend;\\n10° de nadere voorwaarden waaronder het recht om verzoekschriften in te dienen, wordt uitgeoefend, en de wijze waarop de verzoekschriften worden behandeld;\\n11° de wijze van het ter kennis brengen van de beslissingen, vermeld in artikel 51, vijfde lid.\\n\\nDe gemeenteraad kan het huishoudelijk reglement te allen tijde wijzigen.\"\n}, \n\"_:gemeentedecreet-41\": {\n\"ref\": \"a1061862\",\n\"text\": \"De gemeenteraad neemt een deontologische code aan.\"\n}, \n\"_:gemeentedecreet-42\": {\n\"ref\": \"a1061863\",\n\"text\": \"§ 1.

Dat moet gebeuren door een gedagtekende akte van voordracht neer te leggen in de handen van de voorzitter van de raad, uiterlijk drie dagen voor de vergadering waar de voorzitter en het districtscollege worden verkozen. Om ontvankelijk te zijn moeten op een voordrachtlijst zoveel kandidaten voorkomen als er mandaten te begeven zijn. De akte van voordracht moet ondertekend zijn door ten minste een meerderheid van de personen die op dezelfde lijst werden verkozen en door de kandidaten die op de voordrachtlijst voor het districtscollege voorkomen. Ook als op de voordrachtlijst kandidaten voorkomen die verkozen werden op verschillende lijsten, moet de voordrachtlijst telkens ondertekend zijn door de meerderheid van de verkozenen van elke lijst waarvan zich een verkozene als kandidaat op de voordrachtlijst bevindt. In geval de lijst waarop de kandidaat-voorzitter of het kandidaat-lid van het districtscollege voorkwam slechts twee verkozenen telt, volstaat, voor de naleving van het voorgaande, de handtekening van één onder hen. Behoudens in geval van overlijden van, of afstand van het mandaat van districtsraadslid door een voorgedragen kandidaat, kan niemand meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekenen. Een verkozene die meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekent, kan voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de districtsraad niet worden benoemd of verkozen als voorzitter van de districtsraad, lid van het districtscollege of voorzitter van een commissie van de districtsraad en kan de gemeente niet vertegenwoordigen of namens de gemeente een mandaat bekleden in gemeentelijke extern verzelfstandigde agentschappen of andere verenigingen, stichtingen of vennootschappen. Indien de betrokken verkozene reeds een dergelijk mandaat bekleedt, vervalt dit van rechtswege voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de raad.  In geval van overlijden van, of afstand van het mandaat van districtsraadslid door een voorgedragen kandidaat kunnen er, tot op de samenkomst van de districtsraad ter verkiezing van de voorzitter en het districtscollege, nieuwe lijsten worden ingediend bij de voorzitter van de vergadering. Die lijsten moeten aan de bovenvermelde voorwaarden beantwoorden.\\n\\nDe akte van voordracht kan ook de einddatum van het mandaat van de kandidaatvoorzitter en van de kandidaat-leden van het districtscollege vermelden. In dat geval kan op de akte van voordracht de naam vermeld worden van de persoon die hem zal opvolgen of van de personen die hem zullen opvolgen voor de resterende duur van het mandaat. In voorkomend geval zijn de voorzitter en het lid van het districtscollege bij het bereiken van de einddatum van het mandaat van rechtswege ontslagnemend en worden ze van rechtswege opgevolgd door de persoon die in de akte van voordracht als opvolger is vermeld. Als het mandaat eindigt voor de einddatum, vermeld in de akte of als de persoon die in de akte van voordracht is opgenomen als de opvolger van de voorzitter en van het lid van het districtscollege, zijn mandaat niet opneemt, neemt de eerstvolgende opvolger vervroegd het mandaat op. Als de persoon die als laatste opvolger is vermeld, het mandaat niet kan opnemen, wordt tot vervanging overgegaan overeenkomstig paragraaf 2 waarbij het mandaat, tot aan de nieuwe verkiezing, uitgeoefend wordt overeenkomstig artikel 8, § 4, tweede en derde lid, of overeenkomstig artikel 50, § 2 en § 3, met dien verstande dat gemeenteraad moet worden vervangen door districtsraad, gemeenteraadslid moet worden vervangen door districtsraadslid, de schepen vervangen wordt door het lid van het districtscollege en het schepenmandaat vervangen wordt door het mandaat van het lid van het districtscollege.\\n\\nDe eerste op de voordrachtlijst vermelde kandidaat wordt bij verkiezing automatisch voorzitter van de districtsraad. De rangorde van de leden van het districtscollege stemt overeen met de rangorde waarin de lijst werd opgemaakt.\\n\\nDe verkiezing vindt plaats bij geheime stemming en bij volstrekte meerderheid. Als er slechts één lijst werd voorgedragen, verloopt de stemming in één ronde. In elk ander geval en als na twee stemmingen geen enkele lijst de meerderheid heeft verkregen, dan wordt er opnieuw gestemd over de twee lijsten die de meeste stemmen hebben behaald. Staken de stemmen bij herstemming, dan is de lijst die de jongste kandidaat bevat, verkozen.\\n\\nDeze installatievergadering wordt samengeroepen door de uittredende voorzitter van de districtsraad uiterlijk dertig dagen na de installatie van de gemeenteraad.\\n\\n§ 2. Bij een tussentijdse vacature voor het lidmaatschap van het districtscollege of het voorzitterschap, gaat de raad binnen twee maanden over tot de opvolging. De verkozenen voor de raad kunnen daartoe kandidaten voordragen. Hiervoor wordt per mandaat een gedagtekende akte van voordracht neergelegd in de handen van de voorzitter van de raad, uiterlijk drie dagen voor de vergadering waar de verkiezing op de agenda staat.\\n\\nOm ontvankelijk te zijn, moeten de akten van voordracht ondertekend zijn door ten minste een meerderheid van de personen die op dezelfde lijst werden verkozen en door de voorgedragen kandidaat. Als de lijst waarop het kandidaat-lid van het districtscollege of de kandidaat-voorzitter voorkomt, slechts twee verkozenen telt, volstaat, voor de naleving van het voorgaande, de handtekening van één onder hen. Behoudens in geval van overlijden van, of afstand van het mandaat van districtsraadslid door een voorgedragen kandidaat, kan niemand meer dan een akte van voordracht ondertekenen voor hetzelfde mandaat. Een verkozene die meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekent, kan voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de districtsraad niet worden benoemd of verkozen als voorzitter van de districtsraad, lid van het districtscollege of voorzitter van een commissie van de districtsraad en kan de gemeente niet vertegenwoordigen of namens de gemeente een mandaat bekleden in gemeentelijke extern verzelfstandigde agentschappen of andere verenigingen, stichtingen of vennootschappen. Indien de betrokken verkozene reeds een dergelijk mandaat bekleedt, vervalt dit van rechtswege voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de raad.\\n\\nDe akte van voordracht kan ook de einddatum van het mandaat van de kandidaatvoorzitter en van de kandidaat-leden van het districtscollege vermelden. In dat geval kan op de akte van voordracht de naam vermeld worden van de persoon die hem zal opvolgen of van de personen die hem zullen opvolgen voor de resterende duur van het mandaat. In voorkomend geval zijn de voorzitter en het lid van het districtscollege bij het bereiken van de einddatum van het mandaat van rechtswege ontslagnemend en worden ze van rechtswege opgevolgd door de persoon die in de akte van voordracht als opvolger is vermeld. Als het mandaat eindigt voor de einddatum, vermeld in de akte, of als de persoon die in de akte van voordracht is vermeld als de opvolger van de voorzitter en van het lid van het districtscollege, zijn mandaat niet opneemt, neemt de eerstvolgende opvolger vervroegd het mandaat op. Als de persoon die als laatste opvolger is vermeld, het mandaat niet kan opnemen, wordt tot vervanging overgegaan overeenkomstig deze paragraaf waarbij het mandaat, tot aan de nieuwe verkiezing, uitgeoefend wordt overeenkomstig artikel 8, § 4, tweede en derde lid, of overeenkomstig artikel 50, § 2 en § 3, met dien verstande dat gemeenteraad moet worden vervangen door districtsraad, gemeenteraadslid moet worden vervangen door districtsraadslid, de schepen vervangen wordt door het lid van het districtscollege en het schepenmandaat vervangen wordt door het mandaat van het lid van het districtscollege.\\n\\nDe verkiezing vindt plaats bij geheime stemming en bij volstrekte meerderheid door zo veel afzonderlijke stemmingen als er tijdens de vergadering van de raad mandaten te begeven zijn.\\n\\nAls voor een te begeven mandaat slechts één kandidaat werd voorgedragen, verloopt de stemming in een ronde. In elk ander geval en als na twee stemmingen geen kandidaat de meerderheid heeft verkregen, wordt er opnieuw gestemd over de twee kandidaten die de meeste stemmen hebben behaald. Staken de stemmen bij de herstemming, dan is de jongste kandidaat verkozen.\\n\\n§ 3. Het aantal leden van het districtscollege wordt bepaald op maximum tweederde van het aantal leden, bepaald door artikel 44, § 1, toegepast voor de overeenkomstige gebiedsomschijving, met een maximum van vijf. Bij een breuk wordt er afgerond naar het hogere aantal. Artikel 44, § 2, is van overeenkomstige toepassing. De districtsraad kan beslissen dat de voorzitter van de districtsraad geen deel uitmaakt van het districtscollege en het college niet voorzit. In dat geval kiest het districtscollege in zijn midden een afzonderlijke voorzitter van het districtscollege.\\n\\n§ 4. Het districtscollege bestaat uit personen van verschillend geslacht.\\n\\nIndien het districtscollege niet rechtsgeldig blijkt samengesteld te zijn overeenkomstig het eerste lid, wordt het laatste overeenkomstig dit artikel verkozen lid van het districtscollege in rang, van rechtswege vervangen door het op dezelfde lijst verkozen districtsraadslid van het andere geslacht met de meeste naamstemmen. Als verschillende raadsleden van het andere geslacht een gelijk aantal naamstemmen hebben behaald, geniet het districtsraadslid dat de hoogste plaats op de lijst bekleedt voorrang onder die raadsleden. Als er geen verkozen districtsraadsleden van het andere geslacht op die lijst voorkomen, wordt het lid van het districtscollege van rechtswege vervangen door de eerste opvolger van het andere geslacht op die lijst.\\n\\nIn afwijking van het tweede lid wordt, indien het districtscollege niet rechtsgeldig blijkt te zijn samengesteld overeenkomstig het eerste lid, en ingeval het overeenkomstig artikel 274, §§ 1 tot 3, laatst verkozen lid van het districtscollege in rang, bij de verkiezing van de districtsraadsleden verkozen werd op een lijst die maar één kandidaat bevat, het voorlaatste lid van het disctrictscollege in rang vervangen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid. Als ook het voorlaatste lid van het districtscollege in rang verkozen werd op een lijst die maar één kandidaat bevat, wordt het derde laatste lid in rang, of in voorkomend geval het eerstvolgende laatste lid van het districtscollege in rang, vervangen overeenkomstig dezelfde bepalingen.\\n\\n§ 5. De bepalingen van artikelen 47, 48, 49, 50, §§ 2 en 3, 69, 70 , 71 en 74bis zijn, voorzover ze respectievelijk de burgemeester en de schepenen betreffen, ook van toepassing respectievelijk op de voorzitter en op de leden van het districtscollege met dien verstande dat:\\n1° de districtsraad in de plaats treedt van de gemeenteraad, de voorzitter van de districtsraad in de plaats treedt van de voorzitter van de gemeenteraad, het districtscollege in de plaats treedt van het college van burgemeester en schepenen en de districtssecretaris in de plaats treedt van de gemeentesecretaris;\\n2° de wedde van de leden van het districtscollege wordt bepaald door de Vlaamse Regering, daarbij kan rekening gehouden worden met de omvang van de bevoegdheden die aan de districten toegewezen worden, alsook met het inwonersaantal van het district.\\n\\n§ 6.
