In voorkomend geval is de voorzitter bij het bereiken van de einddatum van het mandaat van rechtswege ontslagnemend en wordt hij van rechtswege opgevolgd door de persoon die in de akte van voordracht als opvolger is vermeld.

Bij staking van stemmen in de tweede stemronde is de kandidaat die bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald, verkozen tot voorzitter.

Behoudens in geval van overlijden van, of afstand van het mandaat van districtsraadslid door een voorgedragen kandidaat, kan niemand meer dan een akte van voordracht ondertekenen voor hetzelfde mandaat. Een verkozene die meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekent, kan voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de districtsraad niet worden benoemd of verkozen als voorzitter van de districtsraad, lid van het districtscollege of voorzitter van een commissie van de districtsraad en kan de gemeente niet vertegenwoordigen of namens de gemeente een mandaat bekleden in gemeentelijke extern verzelfstandigde agentschappen of andere verenigingen, stichtingen of vennootschappen. Indien de betrokken verkozene reeds een dergelijk mandaat bekleedt, vervalt dit van rechtswege voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de raad.\\n\\nDe akte van voordracht kan ook de einddatum van het mandaat van de kandidaatvoorzitter en van de kandidaat-leden van het districtscollege vermelden. In dat geval kan op de akte van voordracht de naam vermeld worden van de persoon die hem zal opvolgen of van de personen die hem zullen opvolgen voor de resterende duur van het mandaat. In voorkomend geval zijn de voorzitter en het lid van het districtscollege bij het bereiken van de einddatum van het mandaat van rechtswege ontslagnemend en worden ze van rechtswege opgevolgd door de persoon die in de akte van voordracht als opvolger is vermeld. Als het mandaat eindigt voor de einddatum, vermeld in de akte, of als de persoon die in de akte van voordracht is vermeld als de opvolger van de voorzitter en van het lid van het districtscollege, zijn mandaat niet opneemt, neemt de eerstvolgende opvolger vervroegd het mandaat op. Als de persoon die als laatste opvolger is vermeld, het mandaat niet kan opnemen, wordt tot vervanging overgegaan overeenkomstig deze paragraaf waarbij het mandaat, tot aan de nieuwe verkiezing, uitgeoefend wordt overeenkomstig artikel 8, § 4, tweede en derde lid, of overeenkomstig artikel 50, § 2 en § 3, met dien verstande dat gemeenteraad moet worden vervangen door districtsraad, gemeenteraadslid moet worden vervangen door districtsraadslid, de schepen vervangen wordt door het lid van het districtscollege en het schepenmandaat vervangen wordt door het mandaat van het lid van het districtscollege.\\n\\nDe verkiezing vindt plaats bij geheime stemming en bij volstrekte meerderheid door zo veel afzonderlijke stemmingen als er tijdens de vergadering van de raad mandaten te begeven zijn.\\n\\nAls voor een te begeven mandaat slechts één kandidaat werd voorgedragen, verloopt de stemming in een ronde. In elk ander geval en als na twee stemmingen geen kandidaat de meerderheid heeft verkregen, wordt er opnieuw gestemd over de twee kandidaten die de meeste stemmen hebben behaald. Staken de stemmen bij de herstemming, dan is de jongste kandidaat verkozen.\\n\\n§ 3. Het aantal leden van het districtscollege wordt bepaald op maximum tweederde van het aantal leden, bepaald door artikel 44, § 1, toegepast voor de overeenkomstige gebiedsomschijving, met een maximum van vijf. Bij een breuk wordt er afgerond naar het hogere aantal. Artikel 44, § 2, is van overeenkomstige toepassing. De districtsraad kan beslissen dat de voorzitter van de districtsraad geen deel uitmaakt van het districtscollege en het college niet voorzit. In dat geval kiest het districtscollege in zijn midden een afzonderlijke voorzitter van het districtscollege.\\n\\n§ 4. Het districtscollege bestaat uit personen van verschillend geslacht.\\n\\nIndien het districtscollege niet rechtsgeldig blijkt samengesteld te zijn overeenkomstig het eerste lid, wordt het laatste overeenkomstig dit artikel verkozen lid van het districtscollege in rang, van rechtswege vervangen door het op dezelfde lijst verkozen districtsraadslid van het andere geslacht met de meeste naamstemmen. Als verschillende raadsleden van het andere geslacht een gelijk aantal naamstemmen hebben behaald, geniet het districtsraadslid dat de hoogste plaats op de lijst bekleedt voorrang onder die raadsleden. Als er geen verkozen districtsraadsleden van het andere geslacht op die lijst voorkomen, wordt het lid van het districtscollege van rechtswege vervangen door de eerste opvolger van het andere geslacht op die lijst.\\n\\nIn afwijking van het tweede lid wordt, indien het districtscollege niet rechtsgeldig blijkt te zijn samengesteld overeenkomstig het eerste lid, en ingeval het overeenkomstig artikel 274, §§ 1 tot 3, laatst verkozen lid van het districtscollege in rang, bij de verkiezing van de districtsraadsleden verkozen werd op een lijst die maar één kandidaat bevat, het voorlaatste lid van het disctrictscollege in rang vervangen overeenkomstig de bepalingen van het tweede lid. Als ook het voorlaatste lid van het districtscollege in rang verkozen werd op een lijst die maar één kandidaat bevat, wordt het derde laatste lid in rang, of in voorkomend geval het eerstvolgende laatste lid van het districtscollege in rang, vervangen overeenkomstig dezelfde bepalingen.\\n\\n§ 5.
