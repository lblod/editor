Om ontvankelijk te zijn moet de akte van voordracht tevens ondertekend zijn door een meerderheid van de personen die op dezelfde lijst als de voorgedragen kandidaat werden verkozen. Als de lijst waarop de naam van de kandidaat-voorzitter voorkomt slechts twee verkozenen telt, volstaat de handtekening van een van hen. Niemand kan meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekenen. Overtreding van dit verbod heeft in alle akten van voordracht de ongeldigheid tot gevolg van alle handtekeningen die in strijd met dit voorschrift werden geplaatst. Een verkozene die meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekent, kan voor de duur van de zittingsperiode van de gemeenteraad niet worden benoemd of verkozen als burgemeester, schepen, voorzitter van de gemeenteraad, voorzitter van een gemeenteraadscommissie of lid van de raad voor maatschappelijk welzijn, kan de gemeente niet vertegenwoordigen of namens de gemeente een mandaat bekleden in gemeentelijke extern verzelfstandigde agentschappen of andere verenigingen, stichtingen of vennootschappen, en kan het openbaar centrum voor maatschappelijk welzijn niet vertegenwoordigen of namens het openbaar centrum voor maatschappelijk welzijn een mandaat bekleden in de ziekenhuizen, als vermeld in titel VII, hoofdstuk II, van het decreet van 19 december 2008 betreffende de organisatie van de openbare centra voor maatschappelijk welzijn, in een vereniging of vennootschap, vermeld in titel VIII van het decreet van 19 december 2008 betreffende de organisatie van de openbare centra voor maatschappelijk welzijn, of in andere verenigingen, stichtingen of vennootschappen. Als de betrokkene al een dergelijk mandaat bekleedt, vervalt dat van rechtswege.\\n\\nDe akte van voordracht kan tevens de einddatum van het mandaat van de kandidaat-voorzitter vermelden. In dat geval kan op de akte van voordracht de naam vermeld worden van de persoon die hem zal of de personen die hem zullen opvolgen voor de resterende duurtijd van het mandaat. In voorkomend geval is de voorzitter bij het bereiken van de einddatum van het mandaat van rechtswege ontslagnemend en wordt hij van rechtswege opgevolgd door de persoon die in de akte van voordracht als opvolger is vermeld. Indien het mandaat eindigt voor de in de akte vermelde einddatum of indien de persoon die in de akte van voordracht werd vermeld als zijnde de persoon die de voorzitter zou opvolgen, zijn mandaat niet opneemt, neemt de eerstvolgende opvolger vervroegd het mandaat op. Als de persoon die als laatste opvolger is vermeld, het mandaat niet kan opnemen, wordt tot vervanging overgegaan overeenkomstig § 4.\\n\\nDe akte wordt uiterlijk acht dagen voor de installatievergadering van de gemeenteraad aan de gemeentesecretaris overhandigd.\\n\\n§ 2. Nadat de gemeenteraadsleden de eed hebben afgelegd, overhandigt de gemeentesecretaris de akte van voordracht van de kandidaat-voorzitter aan de voorzitter van de installatievergadering.\\n\\nDe voorzitter van de installatievergadering gaat na of de akte van voordracht ontvankelijk is overeenkomstig de voorwaarden, bepaald in § 1. Alleen de handtekeningen van de gemeenteraadsleden die de eed hebben afgelegd, worden hiertoe in aanmerking genomen, met inbegrip van de handtekeningen van de opvolgers die de akte van voordracht hebben ondertekend en die nadien als gemeenteraadslid de eed hebben afgelegd. In voorkomend geval wordt de voorgedragen kandidaat-voorzitter verkozen verklaard.\\n\\n§ 3. Als geen ontvankelijke akte van voordracht van kandidaat-voorzitter aan de voorzitter van de installatievergadering wordt overhandigd, gaat de gemeenteraad binnen veertien dagen over tot verkiezing van een voorzitter.\\n\\nDe gemeenteraadsleden kunnen hiertoe uiterlijk drie dagen voor de eerstvolgende vergadering van de gemeenteraad een gedagtekende akte van voordracht bezorgen aan de gemeentesecretaris.\\n\\nOm ontvankelijk te zijn moet de akte van voordracht ten minste ondertekend zijn door een meerderheid van de personen die op dezelfde lijst werden verkozen als de voorgedragen kandidaat. Als de lijst waarop de kandidaat-voorzitter voorkomt slechts twee verkozenen telt, volstaat de handtekening van één van hen. Onverminderd § 1, kan elk gemeenteraadslid slechts één akte van voordracht ondertekenen. Overtreding van dit verbod heeft in alle akten van voordracht de ongeldigheid tot gevolg van alle handtekeningen die in strijd met dit voorschrift werden geplaatst. De sanctie vermeld in § 1 ten aanzien van de verkozene die meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekent, is eveneens van toepassing. De akte van voordracht kan tevens de einddatum van het mandaat van de kandidaat-voorzitter vermelden. In dat geval kan op de akte van voordracht de naam vermeld worden van de persoon die hem zal of de personen die hem zullen opvolgen voor de resterende duurtijd van het mandaat. In voorkomend geval is de voorzitter bij het bereiken van de einddatum van het mandaat van rechtswege ontslagnemend en wordt hij van rechtswege opgevolgd door de persoon die in de akte van voordracht als opvolger is vermeld.\\n\\nIndien het mandaat eindigt voor de in de akte vermelde einddatum of indien de persoon die in de akte van voordracht werd vermeld als zijnde de persoon die de voorzitter zou opvolgen, zijn mandaat niet opneemt, neemt de eerstvolgende opvolger vervroegd het mandaat op. Als de persoon die als laatste opvolger is vermeld, het mandaat niet kan opnemen, wordt tot vervanging overgegaan overeenkomstig § 4.\\n\\nDe verkiezing gebeurt bij geheime stemming.\\n\\nDe kandidaat die de volstrekte meerderheid van de stemmen heeft behaald, is verkozen tot voorzitter van de gemeenteraad. Als geen enkele kandidaat de volstrekte meerderheid van de stemmen heeft behaald en als meerdere kandidaten werden voorgedragen voor het vacante mandaat, vindt een tweede stemronde plaats, waarin wordt gestemd op de twee kandidaten die in de eerste stemronde de meeste stemmen behaalden. Bij staking van stemmen in de eerste stemronde komt de kandidaat die bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald, in aanmerking voor de tweede stemronde. De kandidaat die in de tweede stemronde de meerderheid van de stemmen heeft behaald, is verkozen tot voorzitter. Bij staking van stemmen in de tweede stemronde is de kandidaat die bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald, verkozen tot voorzitter. Als de naamstemmen bepalend zijn en de kandidaten een gelijk aantal naamstemmen hebben behaald, is de voorgedragen kandidaat verkozen van wie de lijst bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste stemmen heeft behaald.\\n\\n§ 4. Als de voorzitter het mandaat niet aanvaardt, van zijn mandaat van gemeenteraadslid vervallen wordt verklaard, als verhinderd wordt beschouwd, ontslag genomen heeft of overleden is, wordt tot een nieuwe verkiezing van voorzitter overgegaan op de eerstvolgende vergadering van de gemeenteraad, overeenkomstig § 1 tot en met § 3. Tot aan de nieuwe verkiezing wordt het voorzitterschap waargenomen overeenkomstig het tweede lid.\\n\\nAls de voorzitter om een andere reden dan de redenen, vermeld in het eerste lid, tijdelijk afwezig is, of als hij bij een welbepaalde aangelegenheid betrokken partij is overeenkomstig artikel 27, wordt hij met behoud van de toepassing van de nationaliteitsvereiste vermeld in artikel 8, § 1, eerste lid, als volgt vervangen :\\n1° indien de voorzitter zijn bevoegdheid schriftelijk heeft opgedragen aan een gemeenteraadslid, neemt deze laatste het voorzitterschap waar;\\n2° indien de voorzitter zijn bevoegdheid niet heeft opgedragen aan een gemeenteraadslid overeenkomstig de bepaling vermeld in het eerste punt, neemt het gemeenteraadslid met de meeste anciënniteit het voorzitterschap waar. Bij gelijke anciënniteit geniet het gemeenteraadslid dat bij de laatste volledige vernieuwing van de gemeenteraad het hoogste aantal naamstemmen heeft behaald, de voorkeur. Als het gemeenteraadslid met de meeste anciënniteit de voorzitter in die gevallen niet kan vervangen, wordt het voorzitterschap waargenomen door een ander gemeenteraadslid in volgorde van anciënniteit. Bij gelijke anciënniteit wordt het mandaat waargenomen door het gemeenteraadslid dat bij de verkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald.\\n\\nDe voorzitter die als verhinderd wordt beschouwd of tijdelijk afwezig is, wordt vervangen zolang hij verhinderd of tijdelijk afwezig is. De gemeenteraad neemt akte van de verhindering , en van de beëindiging van de periode van verhindering.

Als geen enkele kandidaat de volstrekte meerderheid van de stemmen heeft behaald en als meerdere kandidaten werden voorgedragen voor het vacante schepenmandaat, vindt een tweede stemronde plaats. Daarin wordt gestemd op de twee kandidaten die in de eerste stemronde de meeste stemmen hebben behaald. Bij staking van stemmen in de eerste stemronde komt de kandidaat die bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald, in aanmerking voor de tweede stemronde. De kandidaat die in de tweede stemronde de meerderheid van de stemmen heeft behaald, is verkozen tot schepen.

De rang van de schepenen wordt bepaald door de rangorde op de gezamenlijke akte van voordracht. In geval van afzonderlijke verkiezing van de schepenen wordt de rang van de schepenen bepaald door de volgorde van de stemmingen. De schepenen die op grond van § 1, tweede lid, § 3, tweede lid of op grond van artikel 44, § 4, tweede lid een schepen opvolgen, nemen de rang in in volgorde van hun verkiezing of benoeming.

Overtreding van dit verbod heeft in alle akten van voordracht de ongeldigheid tot gevolg van alle handtekeningen die in strijd met dit voorschrift werden geplaatst. De sanctie vermeld in § 1 ten aanzien van de verkozene die meer dan één akte van voordracht ondertekent, is eveneens van toepassing. De akte van voordracht kan tevens de einddatum van het mandaat van de kandidaat-voorzitter vermelden. In dat geval kan op de akte van voordracht de naam vermeld worden van de persoon die hem zal of de personen die hem zullen opvolgen voor de resterende duurtijd van het mandaat.

Bij staking van stemmen in de eerste stemronde komt de kandidaat die bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald, in aanmerking voor de tweede stemronde. De kandidaat die in de tweede stemronde de meerderheid van de stemmen heeft behaald, is verkozen tot voorzitter. Bij staking van stemmen in de tweede stemronde is de kandidaat die bij de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald, verkozen tot voorzitter.

Bij gelijke anciënniteit geniet het gemeenteraadslid dat bij de laatste volledige vernieuwing van de gemeenteraad het hoogste aantal naamstemmen heeft behaald, de voorkeur. Als het gemeenteraadslid met de meeste anciënniteit de voorzitter in die gevallen niet kan vervangen, wordt het voorzitterschap waargenomen door een ander gemeenteraadslid in volgorde van anciënniteit. Bij gelijke anciënniteit wordt het mandaat waargenomen door het gemeenteraadslid dat bij de verkiezingen de meeste naamstemmen heeft behaald.\\n\\nDe voorzitter die als verhinderd wordt beschouwd of tijdelijk afwezig is, wordt vervangen zolang hij verhinderd of tijdelijk afwezig is.

De rang van de schepenen wordt bepaald door de rangorde op de gezamenlijke akte van voordracht. In geval van afzonderlijke verkiezing van de schepenen wordt de rang van de schepenen bepaald door de volgorde van de stemmingen. De schepenen die op grond van § 1, tweede lid, § 3, tweede lid of op grond van artikel 44, § 4, tweede lid een schepen opvolgen, nemen de rang in in volgorde van hun verkiezing of benoeming.
